This repository consists of libminesweeper and MineCurses.

# libminesweeper
A free library which implements a minesweeper framework. It manages the game logic
and provides an interface for making game moves.

# MineCurses
A simple minesweeper game using libminesweeper and ncurses. You can specify the field
size and the number of mines at the beginning of the game. Use the arrow keys to navigate,
the return key to make a move and the space bar to set a flag.

It also supports mouse input, though that may be bugged on some implementations of ncurses.
